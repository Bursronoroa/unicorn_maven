![](unicorn.jpg)

## Introduction 

According to google, **Unicorn companies** are those that reach a valuation of **$1 billion** without being listed on the stock market. This means that has its valuation equal to or greater than One Billion Dollars. It may take a few years or might take more than 50 years. This dataset gotten from Maven.com shows more than a thousand companies with their location (city and country), present valuation in dollars, seed capital (Total amount raised across all funding rounds to start the business), date when the company was founded and when it attained Unicorn and so on. The data was a bit messy but I cleaned it up, added some columns and transform some columns on the table 
**_Disclaimer_**: _All datasetand reports do not represent any company, institution or country_
